## Backgammon game

  This project idea bloomed with a strong desire to improve my coding skills and to build something practical with all the knowledge I've acquired through four years of highschool. Managing to arrive to a decent version of a backgammon game, me and the other author of this project(@cuelly3) decided to compete in the 29th edition of the ***National Olympiad of Innovation and Digital Creation*** (Romania), which took place in **July 2022**.<br>
  With our project, we obtained the ***9th place out of 30*** other teams and most importantly, we grasped quite a few skills and got to meet other talented developers from all over Romania.
